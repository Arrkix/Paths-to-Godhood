	The black screen and terminal was the most beutiful raw thing i've ever seen. I was in blind love. It was ~10pm at night and I followed the youtube vids instructions as much as I could. Careful sweating each step as my whole pc/life seemed to be at steak.
	[steps->]
	Following the commands were prtetty simple but I was juggling between tutorial videos.
	-Get the net going {'ping' dissapearing float}
	-fdisk and {FLASH} my original pc memory wiped. Really in the no turning back zone now.
	If i fail i would prolly be kicked out homelss
	-(explain lil GPT MBR partitioning schemes)
	-Mounting filesystems making partitions, which was confusing but i pushed thru
	-Installing linux via packstrap. {satisfying 99% finish}

	All exciting new stuff so far, everything seemed to go in the flow.
	
	Then came the time to chroot (explain chroot) , finally entering my own system. {stars, enter cave}

	Setting up the user, time password... easy so far.
	Then the final task/boss.
	{GRUB bootloader}
	The end felt near. One more step and I can start back in the higher layers of my pc.

	->Install grub
	{FAILED} huh...?

	Turns out jumping between multiple tutorial for diffrent host systems was not a good idea.
  	-I only vaguely understood the UEFI system and how it needed an EFI partition. chat GayPT had stop being a help long time ago. Now assumingly a mistake in my partitioning, filesystem format or something else was breaking my grub
	->It kept throwing me into an empty grub menu

	So ihad to redo, it was around 3am by this time.
	-Redo it not once.. or twice... NOR THRICE!! BUT SO MANY TIMES I LOST COUNT
	It could have easily been like 9 times... i felt SO stupid lmao.

	-My machine was throwing weird noises. It was lil unhinged ngl
	The f4 key was lighting up for some reason. I've never even touced the command prompt in windows before, this was scary shit ;(
	- AT 4 am i decided to give in and ask some help in discord, they told me to chill
	"PC's are not that easy to corrupt or break" and i can close and restart. 
	(one guy said i was doing it unprofessionally, like yes dude ik ;( ((it was weirdly fun still))
	So i decided to not get insomnia yet and slept, putting pc in sleep.

	{Night 2}
	The previous night was insane, i needed a break and didnt do anythign during the day.
	Again during the night.

	Started at around 11 30 pm
	- The main advice I got from everywhere was to FOLLOW THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION.
	So now i had no more excuses left to not read instructions longer than a para. Time to go big brain and I properly followed the "OFFCIAL ARCH DOCS"
	and... well a few a fails and redos
	But then I made the proper EFI folder partition and other necessary stuff 
	and... it worked
	
	{freddy yayy, 5 am clock, yes it was actually 4 am again}
	IT FUCKING WORKED. THE SEXY BOOTLOADER SCREEN WITH ITS BEAUTIFUL FONT AND GREY ASS HIGHLIGHT

	Moannn. That was satisfying good lord. After doing it all, the steps did seem simple in the end mhm.
	I excitedly installed KDE for it, and the graphics was sliccccck, so many features i never saw in windows. 
	I did not know computers had this much depth and beauty to it. 
	I more or less sat in a single room for few days and DERIVED SUCH JOY AND ADVENTURE.
	Is this love? Do computer science students get to enjoy this all the time? lmao
	
	With these straying thoughts, i went to sleep dreaming of the content i could milk from this for years to come.

	{Day 3}
	Well the main part was done, we were out in the sunlihgt.

	Everything after seemed easier after what i went through, learning new things like "package manager, yay, desktop managers" all seemed like skipping stones i was installing and setting up things one after another with no big hitches.



	And well thats the sotry.
	I was an arch user now. And it took me few more days to realize that almost everyone in the arch discord were femboys or gay.
	So ig im that too, and after doubled back on KDE and setup Hyprland, no more denying it.
	And thats when I realized... arch had installed me :(
