<h1>Arch Install</h1>
Arch is a Linux distro infamous in the non-Windows community for being unconventionally hard to install — so much so that users who succeed often brag about it online as a meme.
When I began the install, I only had basic Linux knowledge, but I was curious and wanted to challenge myself.

It took me around three nights, staying up until 4am (partly due to inexperience — doesn’t always take this long 😅), but I eventually succeded.
In the end, it was worth it. I learned a lot about how Linux systems, and picked up a bouquet of soft skills along the way.

This repository documents my experience with Arch — the fun parts, the frustrating parts, and a few humble tips for anyone curious enough to try it themselves.


<h2>Background</h2>
For anyone contemplating to install arch themselves. These are a few tips I personally think could be helpful. 
	-Basic linux commands: Navigation, reading errors, should be second nature. [ I had experience using ubuntu in vm for a few weeks.]
	-Linux system: Good understanding of lower level components of OS, such as partitions, filesystems, mounting. [Nothing in-depth, I read few chapters of linux basic and knew these concepts.]
	-OS: Concepts of booting how hardware and softwares interact. [Again just the overall ideas.]
	-Linux installing: Brief through the basic workflow of installing an OS. [Watch videos, or read articles of the steps of installing Arch.]

	=><u><b>The Arch Installation Guide<b>: The official Arch installing documentation. To be able to read through it, follow its instruction, rereference as many times as required. <u>
		
		This can't be overstressed, of how important the offical Documentation is. It is robust, exhaustive and complete. I made the mistake of following multiple guides/ videos and ended up scarring away several hours of the install. Developing the skill to push through pages of documentation is an invaluable skill, and for arch it is a life saving path that can save hours of headache adn worse.
		So I highly reccomend pushing through reading it even if it feels hard at first. It will pay off when grub fails to install at 4 am midnight (;( ).
